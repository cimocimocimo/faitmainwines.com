				<h1>Shauna Mackenzie<hr></h1>
				<p>
					Like Benoit, I’ve always had the attitude that if I want to do something, I’m going to do it full on. Growing up in Southern California, I lived and breathed surfing culture before moving north to Monterey for college. I discovered wine working at the area’s top fine dining restaurants to pay my tuition, and it quickly became another life passion. I read every wine book I could get my hands on and attended every seminar. I traveled a few years after university, and took a job with New Zealand’s cult Bordeaux blend producer, Stonyridge Vineyards. There I met my future husband, and my wine business skill set… accounting, marketing, and management. When we moved to Napa Valley a few years later, I met Benoit and jumped on the opportunity to put those skills to use helping him build Fait-Main.
