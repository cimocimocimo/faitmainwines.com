				<h1>Benoit Touquette<hr></h1>
				<p>
					I grew up in Lyon thinking I would become a fighter pilot or an engineer. I never considered wine until I was in Bordeaux working mobile bottling lines to pay for graduate school. The infectious passion of the winemakers I met, showing up day after day with the same fire in their eyes, blew me away. I switched my focus to oenology and completed two degrees, then left France to intern with Andy Erickson and explore uncharted possibilities in Napa Valley. I worked hard, learned from everyone, and pushed myself to deliver the kind of winemaking I believe in. I’ve never missed a picking day, and I’ll spend as much time as it takes to get the wines right. I started Fait-Main because I fell in love with a vineyard… and then another, and another. Shauna saves me from myself.
